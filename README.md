# DefaultWeb _ Working Directory
This repository is the default web project that I use in some training courses. 
If you are taking one of my courses, this is the right place to be for the default web project. 

If you are looking for a fancy web template, there are much better resources available to you via a simple search for "free bootstrap/html5 website templates"

Also note: This is not the basic setup. This code has been modified while following a Udemy course.
